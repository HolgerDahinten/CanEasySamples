# CanEasy
CanEasy is a Windows-based development tool that can be seamlessly integrated into any existing toolchain.
With CanEasy real and simulated electronic control units [ECUs] communicate via different buses according to the communication matrix [residual bus simulation].
It supports the protocols SOME/IP, DoIP, UDS, XCP/CCP and the reading of CDD, ODX/PDX, ELF, A2L and MAP files.
Trace files such as ASC/LOG, MDF and BLF can be imported directly for analysis.
Due to the automatically generated panels, the high level of automation and programmability, CanEasy can be used very quickly and flexibly. It saves effort, time and costs compared to common development tools.
